## Description

This was a great assignment. I enjoyed very thoroughly working with the different npm packages of sequilize, express, dotenv, and mysql 2. Furthermore, It was an exciting opportunity getting to utilize sequilze's different functions and methods when working with this assignment. Sequlize seems like a great program and  I will enjoy working with it more in the future. Overall, I have really enjoyed working with the back-end aspect of being developer, and I look forward to working more with front-end and back-end aspects, and also combining the two in the near future.
